# typescript-relay-plugin #

A Typescript transformer to find and replace `Relay.QL` tagged template literals with the output
generated by `babel-relay-plugin`. If your source files are written in Typescript, this can save you
a parse and print step through `babel` and generally having it as a dependency.

### Usage ###

```ts
import * as ts from "typescript"
import {getTransformer, loadSchema} from "typescript-relay-plugin"

const filePaths = ["..."]
const schemaPath = "/path/to/schema.json"
const program = ts.createProgram(filePaths, ts.getDefaultCompilerOptions())

program.emit(undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined, {
  before: [
    getTransformer(loadSchema(schemaPath))
  ]
})
```
